### A simple text processing and word frequency program

The program provides basic text processing and word frequency analysis. The application contains similar functionality in C# and JavaScript to experiment with their implementations. Options include:
- Processing given text on server 
- Processing given text on client side using JavaScript
- Obtaining text from URL (URL must not require JavaScript to function)

The implementation on the server side (C#) includes additional capabilities. The content of meta tags are sorted into a word list and the number of occurrences of those words in the document content is returned in a separate table. It also counts the number of external links present in the document.

Once the text is processed, the results in the Word List table can be sorted by clicking on the table headers. Sorting is not supported for the Meta Words table.
